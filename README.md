## This project demonstrates form validation using JavaScript. While HTML5 provides basic form validation, using JavaScript allows us to:

Provide better user experience with real-time feedback.

Customize error messages more effectively.

Handle complex validation rules that are not achievable with HTML alone.

I built this project to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and understand how to improve form interactions beyond basic HTML capabilities.
